# WELCOME!

## This is a game called Trivia!

## The object of the game is to answer as many questions right from the categories listed and get as much cash as possible. The cash adds up with each right answer selected. If you get three wrong the game is over and you must reset and replay. 

# Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
