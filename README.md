## Project Plan

For my first project I'm going to create a trivia game that allows a user to decide and choose money cards from four different categories. The categories range from difficulties easy-medium-hard and the user has to answer the questions within a 30 second time limit. If the user cannot answer the question within the 30 second time limit, it will automatically be counted as wrong. After getting three wrong answers the game is over. The user wants to try and get the most points/money by the end of the game.

### Idea For The Game Layout

# MVP Goals

- Add a nice start page.
- Have a timer set to an interval of 30 seconds.
- Make sure each card has a right or wrong answer.
- Play again function to reset the game.
- Add a current score function

# Stretch Goals

- Add a second player option.
- Play against the AI.
- Add music
- Add a previous game score under current score
