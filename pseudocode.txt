If the user gets a question wrong update screen with a message saying wrong and make the card turn red.
If the user doesn't answer the question in the 30 second timer window, turn the card red. 
If the user gets 3 wrong the game ends. 

If the user gets a question right make the screen or card say correct and then turn the card green. 
    * Add each card $100, $300, and $500 that is correctly answered and get the sum. 

The game ends when all cards are answered or when the user misses 3 answers.
